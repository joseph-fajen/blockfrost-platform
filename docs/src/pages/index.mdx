# Blockfrost Platform

Blockfrost platform is a software that services a developer-friendly JSON API for the Cardano ecosystem.

It is a replacement for the legacy open source [Blockfrost backend](https://github.com/blockfrost/blockfrost-backend-ryo/) and is targeted at SPOs and other Cardano node operators that want to serve it on their nodes.

## Decentralization

Although it can be run in a solitary mode, it is primarily designed to join a cluster of other Blockfrost platforms to serve the data to the users of the production Blockfrost.io API instance. Learn more about our [Icebreakers program](/icebreakers).
